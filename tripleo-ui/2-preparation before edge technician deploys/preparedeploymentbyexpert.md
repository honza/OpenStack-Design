# Undercloud Install and Preparation by Preparation Expert</br>
Before the edge technician (Jacques) can do his job of installing the OpenStack Overcloud at an edge site, the undercloud needs to be installed and some configuration work needs to take place. This is not part of Jacques role and is captured below as part of a workflow done by what we are calling the "Preparation Expert".

[Preparation Expert Persona - TBD](TBD)

## Identify and Prepare Hardware for Undercloud

- The Preparation Expert needs to identify and prepare the hardware they will be using to install the undercloud on. They will refer to guidance on what the specifications need to be for this hardware.

## Install Undercloud

- The first step of installing the undercloud is to clone and run the TripleO Quickstart project.

## Clone Heat Templates

- The Preparation Expert clones the heat templates that are provided by the TripleO project so that they can make any edits needed for the configuration for their overcloud environment.

## Edit Heat Templates

- Any configuration updates that need to be made should be changed in the YAML files. This includes Network and Storage configuration changes along with creating or editing any custom roles that will be used.
