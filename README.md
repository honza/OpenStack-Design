## TripleO UI

The following is the documented design for the two main workflows that we are looking to support in the TripleO UI along with the edge cases that users might hit.

1. [Deployment Workflow for Edge Technician](https://lizsurette.github.io/openstack-design/tripleo-ui/1-deployment%20workflow%20for%20edge%20technician/1.deploymentbyjacques)

1. [Preparation before Edge Technician Deploys](https://lizsurette.github.io/openstack-design/tripleo-ui/2-preparation%20before%20edge%20technician%20deploys/preparedeploymentbyexpert)

1. TripleO UI Edge Cases
	- [View Plan History](https://lizsurette.github.io/openstack-design/tripleo-ui/3-tripleo%20ui%20edge%20cases/1.viewplanhistory)
	- [Create New Role (Shuttle Selection)](https://lizsurette.github.io/openstack-design/tripleo-ui/3-tripleo%20ui%20edge%20cases/2.createnewrole)
	- [View Service Status](https://lizsurette.github.io/openstack-design/tripleo-ui/3-tripleo%20ui%20edge%20cases/3.viewservicestatus)
